✔✔ Here I will be adding all the Big Projects, Short Assignments, etc. that I will be learning over the period from youtube videos and from various courses inwhich I have enrolled.

Projects:
1. PurchasedBike_Dashboard_Project: I have done this project after learning various basic concepts about Excel from a well curated playlist of Alex The Analyst youtube channel.
                                    Since this is a dashboard project so the first step which I performed in this project was to Clean the Data. The next step was
                                    to visualize the data.
                                    #Excel #DataCleaning #DataVisualization #Kaggle #AlexTheAnalyst
